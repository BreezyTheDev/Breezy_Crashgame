# Breezy_Crashgame

## What is it?

I got bored and made a simple minigame for FiveM. You have a 1 out of 10 chance of being removed from the game when executing the command. Once the command is executed, you must relog in order to play the game again unless given the required permission.

## Commands

`/cgame` - Starts the mini-game.

`/cgamereset` - Requires `chatgamereset.staff` permission
